# AssesmentDay
## How to run
to operate the file locations need to be passed into the program via a command line argument structured as -p "priceCSV fileLocation" -s "saleCSV fileLocation". For example if the files are stored in the same location as the executable simply write <AssesmentDay.exe -s "coffee shop Monday sales" -p "Coffee shop price list">.

The output should show in the command line and be saved into a report.txt file
